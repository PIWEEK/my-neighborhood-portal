# My Neighborhood Portal

This is a prototype of an application that creates a shared wall of the social
network profiles of all the associations and colectives of a town or neighborhood.

It also may display a directory of entities and some shared views like calendar,
map and static pages.

*This is in a early stage*, it's more a "proof of concept" than a finished app.
